# Editing Guidelines

!!! warning "Target Audience"
    This document is written for an English-speaking audience.
    If you are not editing in English,
    a lot of the practices here may not apply to you.
    Always make sure to refer to widely-accepted style guides
    in the language you are editing in.

!!! danger "Editing Bible"
    This document is not the Bible,
    regardless of how authoritative it may sound in some sections.
    Editing is a creative process,
    and there are infinitely many schools of thought on how to best adapt a script.
    This document is simply a style guide to help maintain a somewhat consistent style to Kaleido releases.

Editing plays a crucial role in fansubbing,
helping to make the original text more accessible
and ensuring the intended message is effectively conveyed.
This process can involve various changes,
such as adapting cultural references, rewriting jokes,
or making the dialogue flow more naturally.
There are many different opinions on what makes for good editing,
and many different editing styles to choose from.

This document is a style guide most Kaleido projects follow,
and is intended to provide a consistent style and quality of editing to the group's releases.
Deviations from these guidelines are often intentional,
and may help give more character to a subtitle
or fit the style of the original script better.

How close to this style guide scripts follow
depends on the script and the editor in charge of the project,
but the majority of Kaleido releases
should more or less follow this style guide.

## Grammar and Punctuation

Using proper grammar and punctuation is crucial for creating clear and engaging subtitles.
But there are also some other things to keep in mind,
such as the dialect of English to use.
In the subtitling community,
American English is the standard,
but some groups such as Kaleido use British English for its subtitles.

!!! Note "Consistency"
    British English is more flexible in which spellings you can use,
    as it's not uncommon for both spellings to be commonly accepted.
    However,
    you should strive to keep your spelling consistent throughout the project.

Below is a quick overview of some common differences between British and American English.

!!! example "Differences between British and American English"

    === "-ise/-ize"

        !!! Note "Spelling differences"
            British English spellings often end in "-ise",
            while American English uses "-ize":
            The spelling "-ize" is also often accepted in British English,
            but required in American English.

         | British English              | American English             |

    === "ou/o"

        !!! Note "Spelling differences"
            British English often uses "ou" where American English uses "o":

    === "-re/-er"

        !!! Note "Spelling differences"
            British English often ends words with "-re" while American English uses "-er":

         | British English | American English |
         |-----------------|-------------------|

Besides dialect differences,
there are a couple other "rules" Kaleido follows:

!!! example "Other rules"

    === "All right/Alright"

         "Alright" is almost always spelled as "all right".

         This is the accepted spelling in published writing,
         and is also the spelling we stick to.
         While cases can be made for "alright",
         it is always safer to use our preferred spelling.

         How closely the editor sticks to this rule
         is up to their discretion,
         and there's nothing essentially wrong with using "alright",
         so long as it's not used as a blank stand-in.

    === "OK/Ok"

         "OK" and "Ok" should almost always be fully spelled out as "okay".

         This is strictly for aesthetic reasons,
         and ultimately they mean the same thing.
         If there's an "OK" signage on screen,
         it may be appropriate to keep the abbreviation in dialogue as well,
         but in almost any other case,
         "okay" is preferred.

### Punctuation

Proper use of punctuation is almost always required.
Do not rely on punctuation used in the original Japanese script,
as punctuation rules and styles vary greatly between languages.

!!! example "Punctuation rules"
    === "Comma splices"

        Avoid comma splices.
        This is when multiple independent clauses are joined together with commas
        without any other punctuation to separate them.
        These often result in run-on sentences,
        which can be more difficult to read.

    === "Oxford comma"

        The Oxford comma is highly preferred.
        This will typically reduce ambiguity,
        but [not always](https://www.scribbr.com/commas/oxford-comma/#appositives).

        If you are unsure if an Oxford comma will help,
        it may be indicative that a line should be rewritten.

    === "Abrupt ends"

        Use em dashes (—) for interruptions or abrupt changes in thought,
        not hyphens (-) or double hyphens (--).

        In the case of trailing off,
        ellipses (...) may be used.
        However, also consider whether a full stop (.) would be more appropriate.

    === "Ellipses spam"

        Avoid ellipses like the plague.

        Permit me to be so brazen as to break character and put my full hatred on display here
        (_we will continue with regular programming shortly_),
        but ellipses are almost always unnecessary,
        annoying to read,
        and can usually be replaced with different punctuation.

        Spamming them every time the character has even a _slight_ pause
        is not only annoying,
        but may also give the viewer the wrong impression
        about the character and the conviction put into the line,
        and in the worst cases feels like you're positioning a speed bump
        in front of the viewer while they're trying to read.

        The ellipsis has been abused by many scripts,
        especially in the 2000s.
        Thankfully,
        many editors have started to catch on to this,
        and it is becoming less common.

        Do not take this to mean that you should never use ellipses.
        They can be fantastic tools if used sparingly to convey doubt or uncertainty,
        or a character's trailing train of thought.
        However, not every pause merits an ellipsis,
        and they should absolutely _not_ be placed at the start and end
        of every single incomplete line (looking at you, [a.f.k.])

        !!! failure "Bad use of ellipses (thanks, [a.f.k.])"
             ![Example of bad use of ellipses from a.f.k.'s Lucky Star 06 release](./img/bad-ellipses.png)

        Always consider whether a full stop or even a comma would be more appropriate,
        or if a line even needs punctuation at all
        (such as with broken lines that continue immediately after,
        as is the case with almost every single line in the above example).
        Sometimes a line can be rewritten to convey the intended meaning more clearly
        without forcefully inserting an ellipsis.

        Naturally, in places where ellipses are required
        (such as when a character continues another character's line),
        they are completely fine to use.

        !!! success "Good use of ellipses"
             ![Example of good use of ellipses from Kaleido's Blue Archive 01 release](./img/good-ellipses.png)

        _Also, never use the four-dotted ellipsis._

    === "Japanese punctuation"

        It's not uncommon for Japanese punctuation
        to slip into English scripts by accident,
        especially in the past.
        You should stay on the lookout for these,
        and replace them with appropriate English punctuation where necessary.
        Similarly,
        you should try to avoid being beholden to the original punctuation,
        as the rules differ between English and Japanese.

        Examples of this include:

        - Banginterros (!?)

        In English, it's standard to use interrobangs (?!) to convey surprise and shock,
        whereas in Japanese banginterros (!?) are used instead.
        While banginterros are occasionally found in English,
        they are less standardised.

        - Wavy Dashes (~)

        In Japanese, the wavy dash (~) is often used to indicate a prolonged sound (like "Aah~").
        This is not used in English,
        and should be avoided.

        - Long dashes (――――――)

        These serve a similar purposes to em dashes,
        but can become rather extreme in use
        (admittedly, these are more often found in visual novels than subtitles).
        These should be replaced with appropriate punctuation,
        which depends on the context they are used in.

        - Quote brackets (「 」)

        While these brackets look cool,
        they are not used in English.
        These signify quotes in Japanese,
        and should be replaced with appropriate quotation marks.

### Quotation Marks

The use of quotation marks varies between British and American English,


!!! example "Differences between British and American English"

    === "British English"

        -   Double quotation marks are used when quoting,
        and single marks are used when quoting within quotes.
        -   If the punctuation is part of the quoted material,
        it goes inside the quotation marks.
        If not,
        it goes outside.
        - Exclamation and question marks are placed inside the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted material,
        otherwise they are placed outside.

    === "American English"

        -   Double quotation marks are used when quoting,
        and single marks are used when quoting within quotes.
        -   Periods and commas are always placed inside the quotation marks,
        even if they are not part of the original quoted material.
        -   Exclamation and question marks are placed inside the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted material,
        otherwise they are placed outside.

### Abbreviated titles

While Kaleido typically sticks to British English rules,
there is one notable exception: abbreviated titles.
We follow the American English convention,
and use a full stop after the abbreviation.

| British English | American English |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Mr              | Mr.              |
| Dr              | Dr.              |
| Mrs             | Mrs.             |
| Ms              | Ms.              |

However,
do keep the difference between "Ms.",
"Miss",
and "Ms" in mind.
"Miss" is a respectful way to refer to an unmarried woman,
"Mrs." is used for a married woman,
and "Ms." is when you're unsure,
and generally the safest choice.
If a common joke is that a female teacher is unmarried,
you should refer to her as "Miss" rather than "Ms.".
If it's unknown to some characters
and they wouldn't reasonably assume them to be married,
they should use "Ms." and switch to "Mrs."
if they find out later.

### Numbers

Numbers should be spelled out whenever reasonably possible,
and if the characters-per-second (CPS) allows for it.

| Number | Spelled Out             |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| 36     | Thirty-six              |
| 100    | One hundred / A hundred |
| 991    | Nine hundred ninety-one |

!!! Abstract "Chicago Manual of Style"
    The [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/) has the following rules for numbers:

    -   Spell out numbers one through one hundred.
    -   Spell out multiples of one through one hundred used in combination with hundred, thousand,<br>
        or hundred thousand.

    These are for written text so are not always applicable to subtitles,
    but they're generally good rules to follow.

In some cases,
certain numbers appear frequently in a show.
These should ideally be handled consistently throughout the project,
and be edited while considering how that may impact future lines.

| Original                         | Avoid                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Stop right there, Misaka 9982!" | "Stop right there, Misaka nine-thousand-nine-hundred-eighty-two! |

Dates are an exception to this rule,
and should always be written in numeric form.

| Date                       | Avoid                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st of January             | First of January                                    |
| Oct. 2                     | October Second                                      |
| The 25th of December, 1998 | The twenty-fifth of December, nineteen-ninety-eight |

### Sentence structure

Dialogue flow is one of the core things that Kaleido editors focus on most.
Subtitles are timed to fit the dialogue,
and as such,
it's important to make it as easy as possible for the viewer to understand in a short amount of time
while flowing naturally.

Sentences should be broken up into smaller clauses where reasonable,
and presented to the viewer in a clear and concise manner.
Ambiguity should be avoided,
unless the original script calls for it,
and may require some rewriting to make it clearer.

Japanese grammar is different from English,
so it may be necessary to change the order of information in a sentence to make it sound more natural in English.
The target audience's experience trumps all else,
even if it comes at the cost of minor information loss.

Try to avoid run-on sentences,
as they are difficult to read and understand.
If a sentence is too long,
try to break it up into two shorter sentences.
Exceptions may apply,
such as when a character is speaking very quickly,
or otherwise stumbling over their words.

### Garden-pathing

Garden-pathing is when a sentence is easy to misinterpret when parsed sequentially,
and requires you to circle back to an earlier part of the sentence to understand it.
This is a common mistake made by English learners,
and should be avoided.

Below are a few examples of garden-pathing,
and how you may go about rewriting them[^gardenpath].

!!! example "Garden-pathing"
    === "Example A"

        !!! Quote "Example Sentence"
            "The horse raced past the barn fell."

        !!! abstract "Explanation"
            The reader initially assumes the horse is "racing past the barn",
            but the sentence actually means that the horse _was_ raced past the barn,
            and then it fell.

        !!! note "Rewritten"
            "The horse that was raced past the barn fell."

        !!! abstract "Explanation"
            Adding "that was" clarifies the relationship between the horse and the action of falling.

    === "Example B"

        !!! Quote "Example Sentence"
            "The man who hunts ducks out on weekends."

        !!! abstract "Explanation"
            The reader initially assumes the sentence means that the old man "hunts ducks (the birds) out on weekends",
            but "ducks out" is actually the verb "to duck out" (i.e. leave or avoid something).

        !!! note "Rewritten"
            "The man who hunts hides out on weekends."

        !!! abstract "Explanation"
            Changing the verb to "hides" makes it clear that the old man is trying to avoid something
            while avoiding the misunderstanding that he's hunting a specific animal on weekends.

    === "Example C"

        !!! Quote "Example Sentence"
            "The prime number few."

        !!! abstract "Explanation"
            The reader initially assumes that "the prime number" is the subject of the sentence,
            as in discussing a specific number (maths),
            but the sentence is actually referring to a small number of prime people.
            The "few" does not logically connect to "the prime number" when read sequentially.

        !!! note "Rewritten"
            - "The few prime individuals."
            - "The number of prime individuals is few."

        !!! abstract "Explanation"
            Adding "individuals" makes it clear that the sentence is referring to a group of people.

As illustrated above,
there are a variety of ways to rewrite sentences to avoid garden-pathing:

-   Adding clarifying words (such as "that", "which", or "who")
-   Changing the verb
-   Adding additional context
-   Splitting the sentence
-   Using active voice
-   Reordering the sentence
-   Eliminating unnecessary modifiers or adjectives
-   Using conjunctions ("and", "but", "or", "so", "for", etc.)
