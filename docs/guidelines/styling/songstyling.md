# Song Styling Guidelines

Almost every anime contains songs,
and it is standard practice to style them.
But not all songs and accompanying visuals are created equal.
Some are simple,
only requiring simple styling
to make them stand out from the dialogue.
Others are more complex,
with very dynamic and creative visuals.

## General Guidelines

When styling songs,
it's crucial to strike a balance between creativity and readability.
The primary goal should be to enhance the viewer's experience,
and this can be a very delicate task.

Below are some approaches for determining how to style opening and ending songs.

## Credit Matching

The most common form of song styling is to simply match the credit styling.
Most credits are simply,
and it doesn't take much effort to match the styling.

This type of approach can be very easy,
but sometimes credits can be very complex.
At that point,
how close you try to match the credit styling
is an exercise left to the discretion of the styler,
and the more complex the effect,
the longer it may take to match.
