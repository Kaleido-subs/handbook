# Song Styling Guidelines

Almost every anime contains songs,
and it is standard practice to style them.
But not all songs and accompanying visuals are created equal.
Some are simple,
only requiring simple styling
to make them stand out from the dialogue.
Others are more complex,
with very dynamic and creative visuals.
