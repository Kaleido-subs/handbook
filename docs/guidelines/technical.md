# Technical Guidelines

This section contains technical guidelines for ASS subtitles,
mostly involving technical aspects that ensure subtitles display correctly,
or otherwise improve accessibility for viewers.

These are largely centred on aspects of subtitling outside of directly writing subtitles,
but do also touch upon performance and style override supports.
