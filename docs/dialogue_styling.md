    you may need to adjust values accordingly.

Dialogue styling is a vital,
yet often underappreciated aspect of subtitling.
It encompasses the font, colour, and positioning of dialogue,
all of which can have a profound impact on the viewer's experience.

Out of all topics discussed in this document,
this is arguably one of the most important.
Many groups have different standards and opinions
on what makes for good dialogue styling,
but they should all generally adhere to the following guidelines.

## Font style

Like with most things fonts,
finding the right one is a matter of personal taste
and can take some time.
However,
there are a handful of ground-rules that should be followed:

1. **Legibility**:
   The font should be clear and easy on the viewer's eyes,
   even at smaller sizes or when viewed from a distance.
2. **Serifs**:
   Fonts should ideally be sans-serif,
   but serifs can work if they are clean and easy to read,
   and fit the style and aesthetics of the show.

If you're unsure about what font to use,
it's a good idea to grab established styling from the bigger fansubbing groups
and use that as a base for your own.
The default Kaleido font is [LTFinnegan](https://eng.fontke.com/family/145020/).

Below are examples of other fonts that are recommended for dialogue:

![Common fansubbing dialogue fonts](./img/styling/common-dialogue-fonts.png)

Popular options include Gandhi Sans, Cabin, and Lato.

There may be times where a serif font is preferred,
based on the style of the show.
The pre-established rules for dialogue fonts still apply,
but there is more leeway in terms of what font to choose.

![Kaleido's Fate/strange fake style](./img/styling/serif-dialogue-font.png)

The size of the dialogue is determined by the font size.
This should be set to a value that is large enough to be easily read,
but not so large that it takes up too much of the screen.
For Kaleido,
we use a font size of 72 for the dialogue style.

An often-overlooked part of fonts to consider is line spacing.
If spaced too far apart,
dialogue lines may appear disconnected to a viewer.
On the other hand,
spacing lines too close together can look cluttered.
Due to peculiarities in ASS rendering[^ass-fs],
this also changes the rendered font size.

![Visual examples of how line spacing affects dialogue fonts](img/styling/alegreya-line-spacing.png)

When dealing with a font with ligatures that can be confused for other characters,
it is recommended to either disable them in some fashion
if your subtitling renderer supports that,
or in the case of ASS,
set a font spacing of 0.01 in your dialogue style.

While not required,
it is highly advised you use a font that supports all common characters,
including characters such as the em dash (â€”).
Historically,
fansubbing groups have used in-line tags to widen a regular hyphen,
but this may introduce problems if the viewer overrides the style,
and is also simply a less clean solution
and a bad habit to get into.

If you're subtitling in languages other than English,
make sure the font supports the characters of the languages you are subtitling for.
This is especially important for languages with a large number of characters such as Japanese,
but also languages that make common use of diacritics
such as Spanish, French, and German.

If you're a commercial entity,
you must also make sure that the font is licensed for commercial use.
Failure to do so may result in legal action from the font's copyright holder.

Finally,
you should consider the file size of the font you are using.
Fonts with large character sets can be quite large,
increasing the total size of your subtitles
to include a lot of characters you may not need.

## Colour

The colour is arguably the most important part of dialogue styling.
Using clashing or hard-to-read colours
will immediately detract from the viewer's experience,
so it's important to choose a colour that is easy on the eyes
that is still high-contrast enough to not blend into the video.

A common mantra for colour choices in the fansubbing community is:

![White text with a black border can be read on any color!](./img/styling/white-text.png)

Colours with a similar effect are yellow and cyan,
but those are generally harder to read,
and may cause eye strain.

Avoid changing the colour of dialogue
unless there is a very specific reason to do so.
Changing the colours constantly
will draw too much attention to the subtitles themselves,
and distract the viewer from the video.
Avoid doing silly and unnecesarily distracting things
like changing the border colour to match the speaker's hair colour.

Borders should be a dark colour,
as this increases contrast and improves readability.
In general,
black is the safest choice,
as it is easy on the eyes.
Depending on the aesthetic of the show,
other colours may be used
to better blend in with the video.
Examples include videos with a sepia filter,
or a slight tint across the entire video.
However,
enabling high contrast should remain the end-goal.

In fansubbing,
it is commonplace to use a different colour for overlapping dialogue
that is kept at the same alignment as the dialogue it is overlapping.
A distinction must be made,
so most fansubbing groups will use a different border colour.

Kaleido uses a dark-blue border for overlapping dialogue.

## Positioning and margins

Dialogue should be centred on screen,
and be regularly positioned at the bottom of the screen.
Lines positioned in this manner are easier to read
and help the viewer follow the dialogue.

Dialogue positioned on the top of the screen
is generally reserved for background lines,
lines that are not important for the viewer to understand,
or lines that would otherwise cover important information
at the bottom of the frame.

Alt styling is used for overlapping dialogue
that is positioned at the same location as the current line.
This should primarily be done
if the dialogue is important enough for the viewer to read.
If it's not important,
it should ideally be displayed in a different position instead.

Dialogue should attempt to remain in a relatively same-y position
as much as is reasonably possible.
This helps the viewer better follow the dialogue
and prevents the need to readjust their eyes.
Subtle shifts in dialogue position
can still be used to aid readability
if it would otherwise overlap with certain parts of the video,
such as text.

In certain scenes or for certain types of shows,
there is a bit more leeway in being "fun" with dialogue position.
However,
this should be used sparingly,
and be avoided in important scenes
so as not to distract the viewer's attention.
We will cover this in more depth in the [shenanigans](./shenanigans.md) document.

![Example of "fun" positioning: multiple "Welcome!" lines each horizontally aligned to the speaker](./img/styling/wacky-positioning.png)

Safe margins are margins
that keep the dialogue centred,
even when there is a large amount of text on screen.
If the margins are too small,
the dialogue will "hug" the edges of the screen
and become more difficult to read.
If the margins are too large,
it will start breaking lines more aggressively,
which can have a negative impact
on the timing and editing of the line.

For Kaleido,
we set a margin of 200px for the left and right edges,
and 60px on the top and bottom edges.

![Kaleido's default margins: Left 200, Right 200, Vert 60](./img/styling/kaleido-house-style-margins.png)

Margins also decide when a line of dialogue will be automatically broken.
We will cover this in more depth in the [editing](./editing.md) document,
but it's important to understand
that you will want to avoid breaking lines into more than 2 segments.
Limiting it to 2 segments at most
helps to keep the dialogue from being too fragmented,
and makes it easier for the viewer to read without being overwhelmed.

When manually changing the position of dialogue,
you should ideally override the margins instead of hardcoding a `\pos` value.
This allows for viewers to override the style,
as libass will determine that any event with a `\pos` value set
is not dialogue,
and thus not eligible for being overridden.

## Borders and shadow

Dialogue styling should _always_ have a border.
As explained in the [colours](#colour) section,
borders help to improve readability
by increasing contrast.

Borders should ideally not be too thick,
as this is less pleasant on the eyes,
but also not too thin,
as that can make the dialogue blend in with the video too much.

Safe values for border width are generally between 2.5px and 4px.

Shadows are a nice-to-have addition,
but is not required for dialogue to be readable.
It helps the dialogue "pop" out of the background,
further increasing readability.
Shadows should ideally always be fully black
and slightly transparent.
This helps to ensure that the shadow is not too heavy
and does not overpower the dialogue.

Safe values for shadow offset are generally between 1px and 2px.
For transparency,
a value between 140 and 200 is usually best.

For Kaleido,
we use a border width of 3.6px,
a shadow offset of 1.5px,
and a shadow transparency of 160.

[^ass-fs]: Specifically, \fs doesn't actually determine font size, rather than line spacing. Two lines with \fs72 will have their baselines 72px apart, and be scaled accordingly, causing font size to be reduced.
