# Editing Guidelines

Editing is one of the most important aspects of fansubbing,
and helps make the original text more accessible and better convey the intended message
This may involve various changes, from domestication, rewriting jokes, and making dialogue flow more naturally.
There are many different opinions on what makes for good editing,
and many different editing styles to choose from.
