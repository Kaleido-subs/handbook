# Shenanigans

Shenanigans speak to the more "fun" part of fansubbing.
They're often meant to be humorous or light-hearted,
but can also be used to otherwise enhance the viewer's experience.
This comes with risks however,
as it is incredibly easy to overdo it.

## When and what to avoid

- Overusing effect
- Implementing shenanigans that clash with the tone of the scene or show
- Using effects that may cause discomfort or accessibility issues for viewers

- Staggered timing

## Motion-based shenanigans
