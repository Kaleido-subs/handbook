This document covers different aspects of subtitling best practices.
These guidelines are tailored to portraying subtitles in a way
that is both accessible and appealing to viewers.

The contents of this document are written by and for Kaleido's subtitlers,
and are not affiliated with any streaming service or other entity.
Many guidelines covered here fall in line with common practices
in the English fansubbing community,
but may deviate in certain aspects.

These are not hard rules you must follow to the letter,
nor are they intended to be the definitive word on the subject.
The hallmark of a good subtitler is knowing
how to adapt as the situation demands,
and when one should deviate from the norm.
