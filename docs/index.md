# The Kaleido Subtitling Style Handbook

This document covers different aspects of subtitling best practices.
These guidelines are tailored to portraying subtitles in a way
that is both accessible and appealing to viewers.

The contents of this document are written for and by Kaleido-subs' subtitlers,
and are not affiliated with any streaming service.
Many guidelines covered here are in line with common practices
in the English fansubbing community,
but may deviate in certain aspects.

These guidelines are a living document,
and will be updated as we continue to learn new techniques
and further refine our best practices.

These are not hard rules you must follow to the letter,
and the hallmark of a good subtitler is knowing
how to adapt as the situation demands,
and when one should deviate from the norm or expected practices.

The content we cover is split into the following categories:

-   [Dialogue Styling Guidelines](./guidelines/styling/dialogue_styling.md)
-   [Timing Guidelines](./guidelines/timing.md)
-   [Editing Guidelines](./guidelines/editing.md)
-   [Shenanigans](./guidelines/shenanigans.md)
-   [Song Styling Guidelines](./guidelines/styling/songstyling.md)
-   [Technical Guidelines](./guidelines/technical.md)

Furthermore, we also provide additional resources,
such as links to style guides of streaming services and other groups,
as well as a list of software we recommend [here](./resources.md).
